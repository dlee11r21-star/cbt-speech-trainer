# CBT Speech Trainer (Project "Training Wheels")

An impartial therapy aid that acts as "training wheels" for cognitive behavioral thinking. It identifies cognitive distortions in real-time speech and offers alternative, constructive phrases to expedite the learning process.

## Core Features (The "How")

-   [ ] **Real-Time Transcription:** Captures speech via the phone's microphone and converts it to text.
-   [ ] **Diagnosis Engine (CBT):** Analyzes the text to identify patterns matching known Cognitive Distortions.
-   [ ] **Suggestion Engine (DBT):** Offers a pre-scripted, healthy alternative based on DBT Interpersonal Effectiveness skills.
-   [ ] **Feedback UI:** A simple, non-intrusive UI that displays the "flagged" phrase and the "suggested" alternative.

## 1. Diagnosis Engine: Cognitive Distortions to Flag

-   [ ] **All-or-Nothing Thinking** (e.g., "always," "never," "ruined")
-   [ ] **Blaming** (e.g., "It's your fault...")
-   [ ] **Labeling** (e.g., "You are an idiot," "I am a failure")
-   [ ] **Mind Reading** (e.g., "I know you're mad at me")
-   [ ] **Fortune Telling** (e.g., "This is going to be a disaster")

## 2. Suggestion Engine: DBT Alternatives

-   [ ] **For Blaming:** Suggest an "I feel" statement + DEAR MAN.
-   [ ] **For Labeling:** Suggest separating the person from the action.
-   [ ] **For Mind Reading:** Suggest asking a question instead.
